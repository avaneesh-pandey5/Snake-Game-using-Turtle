# Snake-Game-using-Turtle
A classic Snake game built using Python and the Turtle module.

The game features a snake that grows in length as it eats food while avoiding collisions with walls and its own tail. The game is implemented using object-oriented programming principles and features different difficulty levels.

This project is a great way to practice Python programming and learn about game development with the Turtle module. It's also a fun and addictive game that you can play and share with others.

Instructions: To play the game, simply run the 'snake_game.py' file. Use the arrow keys to move the snake around the game board and try to eat as much food as possible without colliding with walls or the snake's own tail. Enjoy!
